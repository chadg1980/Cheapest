            <p>
            Quitting smoking is one of the healthies things you can do. You have probably heard that hundreds of times, but how much is it costing you per year?</p>
            <p> If you never smoke and want to move along, select another categoy on the left or the button below.</p>
            <p> If you nver smoked and want to find out how much money you saved by NOT smoking continue filling out the form. 

                <p>A pack of cigaretts around where I live in Seattle is about <span id="pack"> $9.00</span>.<br>
                    Roughly %66 of that costs is for taxes, so you might live in an area where smoking is cheaper. <br>

            <h1>Brown Bagging </h1>
            <p>
            Brown bagging a lunch is something I saw my father do for his entire 30 year career. I see coworkers going out to eat every day while complaining about money issues. Let's take a finacial journey into how much my father saved over 30 years and how much my coworkers are spending (or will spend) in 30 years. The goal is to think small habits today, over the course of a career. </p><p>
            Even going to teryaki with a drink will cost about $10.00 per day. You could spend more, or less if you eat off the dollar menu (But how healthy is that?) </p>
            <p>Packing a lunch isn't free , but a sandwhich with lunch meat and yellow mustard will costs an average of $0.75. An average loaf of bread costs $2.40 and can make 10 sandwhiches or $0.24 per day. Lunchmeat can cost $2.50 and can make 5 sandwhiches or $0.50 per day.  If you add a side such as a yogurt for $1.00. $1.75 per day for brown bagging per day. If you have expensive taste, it may cost more.  When you go out to lunch, you will be paying taxes (almost 10% wher I live) and tip (15%) for a 25% increase in eating out over brown bagging. The totals are based on a 5 day work week.</p><p> Go and grab your receipt from your last lunch from work, or look it up on your credit card bill.

            <p>
                I am from Seattle, I understand how important a daily cup of coffee is. Folks are ditching the black coffee for a fancy latte, mocha Or buying an energy drink. Both option get expensive quickly (and are full of sugar). A lot of people spend the money to get their caffeine fix multiple times per day!  Some people spend the money on the drink of choice while, having access to free coffee provided by their workplace! But some still choose to go out and fork over the money anyway!
            </p>
            <p> 
                I brought a coffee from a national coffee chain. The "coffee" was $5.09! I could not believe it! I could have made a keurig for $0.60! See recipt ---->
            </p>
            <p>
                    I will add the option if you bought something cheaper, a drip coffee at a coffee shop is $2.00, a keurig at home is $0.60, gas station coffee $1.50. Brew Coffee at home is something like $0.50. Or drink to coffee provided at work for $0.00. It is up to you. (don't say give up coffee!)
